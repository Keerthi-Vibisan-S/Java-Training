Generics < >
--------
Generics in Java provide a way to create classes, interfaces, and methods that can work with different types while ensuring type safety. Generics allow you to parameterize the types used in a class or method, making it possible to write code that is more flexible and reusable.

1. Type Safety: Generics help ensure type safety by allowing the compiler to perform type checking at compile-time. With generics, you can specify the types of objects that a class or method can work with, reducing the chances of runtime type errors.

2. Code Reusability: Generics enable you to write code that can be reused with different types without the need for typecasting or duplicating code. This promotes code reuse and modularity, leading to more maintainable and efficient code.

3. Collection Framework in java completely uses generics to provide type safety.

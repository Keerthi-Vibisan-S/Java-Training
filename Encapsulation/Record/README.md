Record
------
This was introduced from JDK 14.
Its purpose is to replace POJO boilerplate code or plain data carriers.
Here the Record is a special class that contains data and not meant to be altered. (immutability for its data members)

This contains only fundamental methods such as constructors and accessors, here the best part is the developers dont have to write or generate code for this.

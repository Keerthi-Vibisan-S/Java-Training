Usecase:
-------
If in our project we have a need of data filtering.
So here let's take we have a need of filtering employees based on all of their data members or fields or any conditions.
So if we have 100 fields or need to filter data by 100 ways we cannot write 100 functions to filter data.
So this can be easily solved by using functional interface and with lambda functions.

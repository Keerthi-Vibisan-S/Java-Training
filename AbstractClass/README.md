Abstract class are partially implemented class.
Use an abstract class when you want to provide default implementations for some methods while leaving other methods to be implemented by the subclasses.

What is the difference betweeen Abstract Class and an Interface:
---------------------------------------------------------------
1. Interface all data members are static and final by default, so the values of those can't be changed. But in Abstract class we can use the data members as we need.
2. Interface cannot have a constructor and an abstract class can have.
3. Interface is mostly used for 100% Abstraction.
4. Abstract class can be extended and used in Inheritance for providing hierarchial relationship.

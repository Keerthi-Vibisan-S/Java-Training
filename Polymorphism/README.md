Polymorphism
------------
Several or more than one form.
This means ability of a function to perform more than one task.
Overloading - Static Polymorphism
Overriding - Dynamic Polymorphism or Dynamic Method Dispatch. (Here the user or developer does not play a role, whole thing is whith java compiler as it comes to know which function to be called based on the object (Runtime)).

Why?
----
this allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass or interface. It enables code to be written in a more generic and flexible manner, promoting code reuse and extensibility. 

Why we need polymorphism
------------------------
1. Code Reusability - Polymorphism allows you to write code that can work with objects of multiple classes as long as they implement a common interface or share a common superclass.

2. Polymorphism allows you to easily extend your code by adding new classes that implement a common interface or extend a common superclass. 

3. Method overriding: Polymorphism enables you to override methods in subclasses to provide specialized implementations. 

4. Interface-based programming: Polymorphism is essential for interface-based programming, where you define contracts (interfaces) that classes must implement.
